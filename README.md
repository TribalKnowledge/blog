# Blog
Reality and programs like it -or- Two engineers with opinions about programming.

## Where am I?
Have you ever seen the movie Highlander? If you haven't, you should go watch it, Sean Connery is in it. It doesn't have anything to do with this repository, but it's a good waste of a couple hours.

If you've somehow made it here, welcome to a blog about programming. This is our working repo for all the things we want to remember, some opinions we've formed over the years and some general practices we wanted to be able to reference whenever 2pm rolls around and we're waiting for the chocolate covered almonds and cold brew to kick in. Who knows, we may even throw in some basic bits of code that we always seem to have to write so that we can stop. writing. them.

Long story short, this is basically a blog, but one that has stuff in it that we want to be able to reference every day. You know, useful things.

## Who are we (who we are?)
We are a couple of mobile devs, one Android and one iOS, who have worked on some interesting projects, taken some shells in the trenches, and need some reference material that we can easily use to make our jobs easier.

## How to contribute
Caught a typo? See something that is actually *terrible* practice? Want to write a thing about a topic that you have experience in and want to remember? Don't be shy and put up a PR. Hell, you can start a whole new section for whatever language or discipline you'd like to talk about. At the very least we can have an interesting discussion, but probably you have some valuable experience that we don't.

## Where to start
Highlander.

	- Making code that is easy to understand and debug.
	- Don't to more than necessary, agile programming.
- Programming goals. What the outcome should be of a bit of code.
	- Simplicity, readability, testability, etc.
	- General outlook on life and how it feeds into bias in programming.
- Building a feature. What are some of the questions that should be asked before writing some code.
	Are the requirements complete and do you have all the assets to perform the work?
	Are there acceptance criteria?
	Does this feature share concepts with other features that exist in the codebase already?
	How do you want to test it?
- Debugging. Some strategies and things to remember, common reasons that things blow up.
- Source control and branching strategies, releasing software and patching bugs.
- How to think about solving problems. Where is the appropriate level to abstract, and what are some of the consequences of changing something further down as opposed to bolting a solution onto the immediate offending area?
